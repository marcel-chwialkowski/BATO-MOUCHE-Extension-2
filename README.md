### 1. Overview

--- 

This project is the extension work of the ENSAE BATO-MOUCHE project by Simon GENET, Leopold MAURICE, and Marie-Olive THAURY. Please find the Github webpage of their work in this [link](https://github.com/LeoMaurice/BATO-MOUCHE-Stat-App). In our project, we introduce public transport as consideration and we build the 2SFCA method and TOP degree measurement based on it.

The project is supervised by Prof. Sarah J. Berkemer.

### 2. Dataset and Result

---
Providing links and resources that can assist in accessing the fundamental databases required to run this project.
1. **Filosofi dataset:** [Données carroyées – Carreau de 200m](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4176290?sommaire=4176305#consulter). Here we mainly use the dataset with the name of **Carreau 200m – Geopackage – Métropole - Martinique - La Réunion**. Or you can download it more straightforward through this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wpwrlVyq3imUojd2cAJYNAjXZcGhA7cr?usp=sharing). Then also provide the dataset with 1km × 1km grid in [Données carroyées – Carreau de 1km](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4176293?sommaire=4176305). You can find all the explanation for the variables in this [webpage](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4176290?sommaire=4176305#dictionnaire).

2. **OSMnx documentation:** [https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - The document to introduce **OSMnx** package with Python.

3. **OpenStreetMap Wiki:** [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) - In this website, you can find the tags of each node, facility, amenity, transportation in the map, which you need those tags to absorb the data you need for the OSM.

4. **Geopandas:** [https://geopandas.org/en/stable/](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/)

5. **OSMnx:** OSMnx utilizes the Overpass API to access OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. It encapsulates this access, simplifying and rendering OSM network graphs more realistically. Additionally, OSMnx incorporates algorithms for network analysis. As of now, OSMnx stands as arguably the most efficient tool for accessing OSM data.

Since running the whole program for one time is quite long, we provide the result in `.csv` format [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ucJszZOcDgbacrrGILFLS_E4nszXgChT?usp=drive_link).
