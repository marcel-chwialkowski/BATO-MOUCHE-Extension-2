# Lab Research Project

## Project: Accessibility analysis of Paris based on available amenities 

The project is an extension of the BATO-MOUCHE project by Simon Genet, Leopold Maurice and Marie-Olive Thaury. It is also inspired by the work of Yubo Cai (BX24) in his last year's Computer Science Research Project. [Link to the BATO-MOUCH project](https://github.com/LeoMaurice/BATO-MOUCHE-Stat-App).

## External data
Here is where the data used for this project can be found.

1. **Filosofi dataset:** [Données carroyées – Carreau de 200m](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4176290?sommaire=4176305#consulter). Here we use the dataset with the name of **Carreau 200m – Geopackage – Métropole - Martinique - La Réunion**.

2. **OSM extracts** Extracts from Open Street Map can be obtained via a number of ways. In some parts of the project, the [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library is used for that, you can also download an extract of the whole 
Île-de-France region [here](https://www.interline.io/) (registration required but free). We found it useful for quick manipulation of the extract.


5.  **France GEOJSON files** - Useful for obtaining an OSM extract with a specific shape. Link [here](https://france-geojson.gregoiredavid.fr/)

6.  **GTFS file for IDFM** - Required for calculating travel times. Available [here](https://data.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/explore/dataset/offre-horaires-tc-gtfs-idfm/information/) after registration, but free of charge.

 ## Intermediate results
We provide analysis results for 3 regions: Paris, Paris with Petite Couronne, Petite Couronne. They can be found [here](haha).
